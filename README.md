Assignment:
---------

1. Read and complete the SQL Course at http://www.sqlcourse.com. You should be comfortable creating tables, inserting records, finding records, updating records, and deleting records
1. Create a SQL script (in a gist) that accomplishes the following:

* Creates a table for "cities" with the following information.

```
Place name    2013 Estimate   2010 Census   Change
Houston       2,195,914       2,100,263     4.55%

Dallas        1,257,676       1,197,816     5.00%
Austin        885,400         790,390       12.02%
Fort Worth    792,727         741,206       6.95%
```

* Insert data for each row
* Write a SQL Statement which will find all records (with all fields) in the
  table
